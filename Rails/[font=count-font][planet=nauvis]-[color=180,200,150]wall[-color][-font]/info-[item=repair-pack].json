    "description": "REPAIR PACKS NOT INCLUDED\nIt's cheaper to replace broken walls and sometimes turrets or power poles than constantly replace bots flying into fire, acid and maw to repair a 99% healthy wall that costs 5 stone bricks with a 100% new repair pack, losing that too.\nReplace jobs also don't require them to stay in place for a while like repairing does so robot speed directly contributes to robot survivability.",
