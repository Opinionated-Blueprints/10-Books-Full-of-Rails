    "description": "14x14 grid (1/3 of regular rail)\nIntegrates well with other rail blueprints (needs adapter for diagonal)\n(try to) keep long enough distances between intersections to fit a full train (this applies to all rail. It's just easier to mess up here due to the small grid)\n\nPower poles can't be used to remove unwanted signals when overlapping blueprints like in the non-elevated version, but the positioning is such that these unwated signals will be in illegal positions afterwards and won't split blocks.",
