###### Quarantine proved to be the perfect time to spend more than a week pretty much only designing some intersections. I've got to 107 before I finally said to myself: "ENOUGH" (I've still had some ideas tho). Actually, there are 214 blueprints, but half of that is just versions with solar panels and accumulators fit in between the lanes because "why not?". At first, these were called "Books of 1001 Railway Blueprints" and there were 10 books to get separately, but since 1.0 came out, I've decided to finally make use of book nesting from so it's all in one now.  Hope you'll enjoy, and remember: Factory Must Grow.
# Features: 
- All blueprints are always upgradeable into their equivalents from other books placed lower on the list in the "Books" section as long as they are in the same category
 - some blueprints are upgradable into others from the same book or even other categories
   - some of that upgradability was sacrificed for the sake of throughput
 - to achieve that, many blueprints don't have the best possible signal placement
- Each book comes in 2 variants:
 - standard (no ![brackets](https://wiki.factorio.com/images/thumb/Solar_panel.png/32px-Solar_panel.png) &![brackets](https://wiki.factorio.com/images/thumb/Accumulator.png/32px-Accumulator.png))
 - ![brackets](https://wiki.factorio.com/images/thumb/Solar_panel.png/32px-Solar_panel.png) &![brackets](https://wiki.factorio.com/images/thumb/Accumulator.png/32px-Accumulator.png) included because why would you want to waste so much space (aesthetics first though)
   - there are some paths left between solar panels so you can get run over by a train again
- Spacing between lanes is 3 ![brackets](https://wiki.factorio.com/images/thumb/Straight_rail.png/32px-Straight_rail.png) between inner lanes and 2 ![brackets](https://wiki.factorio.com/images/thumb/Straight_rail.png/32px-Straight_rail.png) between outer and inner lanes
- Made for 6 ![brackets](https://wiki.factorio.com/images/thumb/Locomotive.png/32px-Locomotive.png)/![brackets](https://wiki.factorio.com/images/thumb/Cargo_wagon.png/32px-Cargo_wagon.png) trains, but works well with 2, and 3 ![brackets](https://wiki.factorio.com/images/thumb/Locomotive.png/32px-Locomotive.png)/![brackets](https://wiki.factorio.com/images/thumb/Cargo_wagon.png/32px-Cargo_wagon.png) (to maximize throughput add signals on non-crossing lanes) and with multiples of 6 (you'll need to increase space between intersections accordingly to avoid potential deadlocks)
- ![brackets](https://wiki.factorio.com/images/thumb/Green_wire.png/32px-Green_wire.png) & ![brackets](https://wiki.factorio.com/images/thumb/Red_wire.png/32px-Red_wire.png) + ![brackets](https://wiki.factorio.com/images/thumb/Lamp.png/32px-Lamp.png) included
- Modular
- Right-Hand Drive
- Rich Text heavy - it's awesome, believe me
- Each section is 21x21 ![brackets](https://wiki.factorio.com/images/thumb/Straight_rail.png/32px-Straight_rail.png) or 42x42 tiles big (books are focused on throughput for 6  ![brackets](https://wiki.factorio.com/images/thumb/Locomotive.png/32px-Locomotive.png)/![brackets](https://wiki.factorio.com/images/thumb/Cargo_wagon.png/32px-Cargo_wagon.png) trains and that is exactly the border length of the square in which all blueprints here fit, hence they are not chunk aligned)

# Notes:

- Outer lanes in 4-way Intersections from 4 Lane books (category A) do not have left turns. Use Line changers provided
- Category B has some split junctions. The main difference between B and C is that category C blueprints all have the same number of lanes. Blueprints from category B don't
- Remember to leave enough space between each section with lanes crossing each other to fit the longest train that is going to use that part of your network. Otherwise, when it stops on the next signal, it WILL block trains on other lanes. That is true for any train network, not only one built with my blueprints
- No ![brackets](https://wiki.factorio.com/images/thumb/Roboport.png/32px-Roboport.png) so you don't accidentally recreate [Population transfers in the Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_transfer_in_the_Soviet_Union), except bots
- ![brackets](https://wiki.factorio.com/images/thumb/Copper_cable.png/32px-Copper_cable.png) look cool

All designs are made by me and any similarities are coincidental, though I was heavily influenced by these books:
